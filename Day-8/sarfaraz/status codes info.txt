1xx Status Codes [Informational] ->

100 Continue
An interim response. Indicates to the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client SHOULD continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.

102 Processing (WebDAV)
Indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.

200 OK
Indicates that the request has succeeded.

208 Already Reported (WebDAV)
